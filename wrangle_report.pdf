wrWrangle and Analyze Data Report
Manar albogami (Data Analyst Nanodegree)
The purpose of this project is to put in practice what I learned in data wrangling data section
from Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree program. The dataset that is wrangled is the tweet
archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs
What is Data Wrangling?
Data Wrangling is a process where first data is gathered from different sources,
then the quality
of the data is assessed and finally the data is cleaned to create a dataset on which exploratory
data analysis could be performed.
1. Data Gathering
Gathering :
• import CSV for WeRateDogs Twitter archive using the provided
twitter-archive-enhanced.csv file
Programmatically download the image-predictions.tsv file through the Requests
library
Download data JSON file called tweet_json.bxt
2. Assessing Data
Assessing is the second step in the data wrangling process:
Programmatic assessment: using code to view specific portions and
summaries of the data (pandas' head, value_counts(), sample () and
info methods
Twitter_archive dataset
First:
• Quality:
Null values recorded as None and NaN(missing values)
• tweet_id type is int64 ,i will chanage tweet_id data type to string
convert timestamp to be datetime and rename the column into tweet_date
• source mixed html tag
We have some columns that contain unnecessary data: in_reply_to_status_id,
in_reply_to_user_id, retweeted_status_id, retweeted_status_user_id,
retweeted_status_timestamp .... delet unneed column
Second:
• Tidiness:
The 4 different columns doggo, floofer, pupper and puppo, combine in one
columns represent stages_of_dogs"angle_report
